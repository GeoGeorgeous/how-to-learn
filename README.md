### About the project
**How To Learn** is the first website I made during two spirits in [Practicum by Yandex](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/).

The main message is to point out the problems you may face during education and suggest techniques that will boost your learning easily. You will learn about five practices from Barbara Oakley (as well as her biography) aimed at managing attention and memory.
TED videos will introduce you to *procrastination* â€” the reason this text was written deeply at night. Also, you will find amazing facts about the work of the human brain and reade-to-use learning principles from Josh Kaufman. And in the end I will show you the path to the exiting world of learning so you can carry on: links to useful resources and a book recommended by the author of Â«Star WarsÂ».
